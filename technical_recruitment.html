You want to build a great team, but how do you go about it if you're maxed-out writing features or don't have experience with technical interviews? How do you ask the right questions to find a great addition to the team?

We'll work with you to figure out what skills you need, and how to get to where you want to be with the budgets you have. We'll review CVs, carry out pre-interview screening, and provide technical competency tests where needed.

    <h4>Diversity</h4>
    <p>
      We firmly believe that diversity is key to building a strong team and getting the best work done. This doesn't mean lowering the bar â€“ it means making the extra effort to reach out to people who might not otherwise hear about a position, and ensure the recruitment process is a safe and accommodating space.

    <h4>Empathy</h4>
    <p>
      Our process is built around the principle that we're all human, and that the stresses of applying for a job don't necessarily reflect everyday work. We strive to create a friendly environment where candidates are able to shine.

  If that sounds like the sort of team you'd like to build, we'd love to help.
